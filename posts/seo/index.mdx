If you are here it means that you care about organic SEO and want more people to
discover your content. This makes total sense, otherwise why even bother
creating content? In this blog post we are going to discuss what we as engineers
can do better in order to make web crawler's life a little easier and hopefully
get rewarded for it. Gatsby and `react-helmet` are going to be our main weapons.

## Prerequisites

I'm making several assumptions in this article:

1. You already have a basic understanding of how Gatsby Node API and GraphQL
   works.
2. The project I'm going to show will have a certain project structure,
   which we will go over shortly. Though don't worry too much about this part,
   because it should be pretty easy to adopt the same principals for a project with
   a different project structure.
3. All blog post examples are written in MDX, so if you are using markdown instead
   you will have to find another way for using `ImageSharp` with image paths taken
   from frontmatter.

And finally if you have any questions feel free to look at the
[final version](https://github.com/iamskok/gatsby-seo)) of the project
or [tweet](https://twitter.com/iamskok) at me with your question.

## Project Structure

The blog we are going to work on has 4 pages - Home, Blog, Contact, and About as well
as 1 template - Article. I prefer to keep the actual content outside of `./src` direcotry
in order to have a clear separation between source code and the actual content. The
content folder can be named as `posts`, `articles`, or `garden` (AKA
[digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)). I'm gonna roll with `posts`.
Every post will be living in it's own folder with an `index.mdx`. All images which will
be used in the post will also be placed in the same `posts` directory. Generic
images are stored in `./src/images`. And that's about it for the project structure,
everything else is pretty standard.

```

## Site Metadata and `useSiteMetadata` Hook

Before jumping right into the actual coding we have to define define
the data we are going to pass to the SEO components as well as some
mechanism for retrieving the data.

In order to keep `gatsby-config.js` file slim let's create a separate file
which is gonna hold all the static metadata about our blog -
`touch site-metadata.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  firstName: `Jane`,
  lastName: `Doe`,
  siteUrl: `https://gatsby-seo.netlify.app`,
  logo: {
    url: `logo.jpg`,
    width: 640,
    height: 640,
  },
  language: `en_US`,
  socialMedia: {
    twitter: `https://twitter.com/gatsbyjs`,
    github: `https://github.com/gatsbyjs`,
  },
  address: {
    addressCountry: `US`,
    addressLocality: `Los Angeles`,
    addressRegion: `GA`,
  },
  speakableSelector: [`[data-speakable="true"]`],
  pages: {
    home: {
      to: `/`,
      breadcrumb: `Home`,
      title: `Jane Doe`,
      description: `Jane Doe's personal blog`,
      coverAlt: `Two corgis sitting next to each other`,
      type: `WebPage`,
    },
    blog: {
      to: `/blog/`,
      breadcrumb: `Blog`,
      title: `Blog`,
      description: `Thoughts on software engineering`,
      coverAlt: `Brown retriever is licking it's nose`,
      type: `Blog`,
    },
    contact: {
      to: `/contact/`,
      breadcrumb: `Contact`,
      title: `Contact Jane Doe`,
      description: `Jane Doe's contact information`,
      coverAlt: `Bulldog is chilling on the groud`,
      type: `ContactPage`,
    },
    about: {
      to: `/about/`,
      breadcrumb: `About`,
      title: `About Jane Doe`,
      description: `Jane Doe's biography`,
      coverAlt: `French bulldog is hanging out on the playgroud`,
      type: `AboutPage`,
    },
    article: {
      type: `Article`,
    },
  },
}
```

- `speakableSelector` this is a selector which will tell search engines and some other assistive
  technologies that a particular section on the page is "speakable".
- `to` is a URL pathname.
- `breadcrumb` is a breadcrumb title
- `coverAlt` is the same as image `alt` attribute, but for your cover images.
- `lang` the language of your content. Consists of [language code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp)
  and an options [country code](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_country_codes.asp)

Everything else should be pretty self-explanatory. Replace all the values
with your own information, but keep page's `type` as is.

Our next step is to import this file in `gatsby-config.js` so all this information will
become accessible to the GraphQL layer.

```js
const siteMetadata = require("./site-metadata")

module.exports = {
  siteMetadata,
  // ...
}
```

Once we placed the data in the right place we need some way to retrieve it from
react components using GraphQL queries. `useStaticQuery` is exactly what we are
looking. Create `hooks` directory in `./src` - `touch src/hooks/useSiteMetadata.js`

```js
import { useStaticQuery, graphql } from "gatsby"

export default () => {
  const {
    site: { siteMetadata },
  } = useStaticQuery(
    graphql`
      query {
        site {
          siteMetadata {
            firstName
            lastName
            siteUrl
            logo {
              url
              width
              height
            }
            language
            socialMedia {
              twitter
              github
            }
            address {
              addressCountry
              addressLocality
              addressRegion
            }
            speakableSelector
            pages {
              home {
                to
                breadcrumb
                title
                description
                coverAlt
                type
              }
              blog {
                to
                breadcrumb
                title
                description
                coverAlt
                type
              }
              contact {
                to
                breadcrumb
                title
                description
                coverAlt
                type
              }
              about {
                to
                breadcrumb
                title
                description
                coverAlt
                type
              }
              article {
                type
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    `
  )

  return siteMetadata
}
```

We are listing every property from `./site-metadata.js` in the graphql query,
destructuring `siteMetadata`, because we are not making any use out of it and now
we are ready to retrieve the data as:

```jsx
import useSiteMetadata from "../../hooks/useSiteMetadata"

const Welcome = () => {
  const { firstName } = useSiteMetadata()

  return <h1>Hello! My name is {firstName}</h1>
}
```

## Basic Data Flow

All the data brewing will start at the page and template level. We are going
to retrieve it using gatsby page queries and `useSiteMetadata` hook.
After this it's going to drain down in the `Layout` component. `Layout` component
will be a place where all the data is aggregated, sorted, and passed deeper
in the actual SEO components.

## Fetching Page Level Data

- gatsby page query
- useSiteMetadata
- Home, Blog, Contact, About, Article pages.
