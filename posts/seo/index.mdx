- Structured data

## Generic SEO tags

```jsx
<title>Title</title>
<meta name="title" content="title" />
<meta name="description" content="Description ..." />
```

## Open graph

We are going to use 2 different OG types:

- `website` for homepage
- `article` for blog posts

The most frequently recommended resolution for an OG image is 1200 pixels x 627 pixels (1.91/1 ratio).
Donâ€™t exceed the 5MB size limit.

Note about [`og:see_also`](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27913739/how-are-open-graph-ogsee-also-tags-intended-to-behave-in-facebook)

## Twitter

```jsx
<meta property="twitter:card" content="summary_large_image" />
<meta property="twitter:url" content="https://example.com/" />
<meta property="twitter:title" content="Title" />
<meta name="twitter:creator" content="@username" />
<meta
  property="twitter:description"
  content="Description"
/>
<meta
  property="twitter:image"
  content="https://example.com/cover.jpeg"
/>
<meta
  property="twitter:image:alt"
  content="Image description"
/>
```

- `twitter:site` The Twitter @username the card should be attributed to.
- `twitter:image` Images for this Card support an aspect ratio of 2:1 with minimum dimensions of 300x157 or maximum of 4096x4096 pixels. Images must be less than 5MB in size. JPG, PNG, WEBP and GIF formats are supported.
- `twitter:image:alt` Maximum 420 characters.

When using Twitter cards validator make sure that you are not blocking Twitter bot from crawling your website.

```
{
  resolve: `gatsby-plugin-robots-txt`,
  options: {
    host: `example.com`,
    policy: [
      {
        userAgent: `*`,
        allow: [`/`],
      },
    ],
  },
},
```

## JSON-LD Markup

- website `/*`
- person `/*`
- article `/blog/article-title`
- item list `/blog`
- breadcrumbs `/blog` + `/blog/article-title`
- comments

Use Node Identifiers (the "@id" properties) to reference schemas without repeating data needlessly.
URLs with hashes is a common convention, but it can be anything as long as it is locally unique on
the webpage. Read more about [Node Identifiers](https://webmasters.stackexchange.com/questions/98569/what-is-the-use-of-id-in-json-ld-syntax)

Add `data-speakable="true"` for main content area and target it with Article's `speakable` property.
Even though by schema.org specification Article's publisher property can be a Person type structured
data validator throws error and requires Organization type.

When validating `BreadcrumbList` in https://search.google.com/test/rich-results you might ask yourself
why I don't have any errors, but I see `Unnamed item`. Well I don't know why it's working the way it does,
but if it bothers you can add `name` property in `BreadcrumbList`:

```json
{
 "@context": "http://schema.org",
 "@type": "BreadcrumbList",
  "name": "Blog Breadcrumbs",
 "itemListElement": [...]
}
```

Note about [speakable](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/data-types/speakable) data type.

### Images in Article markup

- Images should be at least 696 pixels wide.
- For Article markup use 1x1 / 4x3 / 16x9 image ratio

```
image": [
  "https://example.com/photos/1x1/photo.jpg",
  "https://example.com/photos/4x3/photo.jpg",
  "https://example.com/photos/16x9/photo.jpg"
]
```

### Logo

The image must be 112x112px, at minimum.

## Website

- [Schema reference](https://schema.org/WebSite)

## Pulling data

`gatsby-node` => `template component` => `Layout` => `Head`

Here is a list of things we will need:

- dynamic
  - title
  - description
  - url
  - image
  - imageAlt
- static

  - author

- Site metadata
- Gatsby node context

## Conclusion

There many other schema.org data types, but not all of them work as rich snippets.
Also structured data doesn't directly improve SEO, but it helps search engines better
understand the content of your website. Read more about it in this
