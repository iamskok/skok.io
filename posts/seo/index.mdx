If you are here it means that you care about organic SEO and want more people to
discover your content. This makes total sense, otherwise why even bother
creating content? In this blog post we are going to discuss what we as engineers
can do better in order to make web crawler's life a little easier and hopefully
get rewarded for it. Gatsby and `react-helmet` are going to be our main weapons.

## Prerequisites

I'm making several assumptions in this article:

1. You already have a basic understanding of how Gatsby Node API and GraphQL
   works.
2. The project I'm going to show will have a certain project structure,
   which we will go over shortly. Though don't worry too much about this part,
   because it should be pretty easy to adopt the same principals for a project with
   a different project structure.
3. All blog post examples are written in MDX, so if you are using markdown instead
   you will have to find another way for using `ImageSharp` with image paths taken
   from frontmatter.

And finally if you have any questions feel free to look at the
[final version](https://github.com/iamskok/gatsby-seo)) of the project
or [tweet](https://twitter.com/iamskok) at me with your question.

## Project Structure

The blog we are going to work on has 4 pages - Home, Blog, Contact, and About as well
as 1 template - Article. I prefer to keep the actual content outside of `src` direcotry
in order to have a clear separation between source code and the actual content. The
content folder can be named as `posts`, `articles`, or `garden` (AKA
[digital garden](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden)). I'm gonna roll with `posts`.
Every post will be living in it's own folder with an `index.mdx`. All images which will
be used in the post will also be placed in the same `posts` directory. Generic
images are stored in `src/images`. And that's about it for the project structure,
everything else is pretty standard.

```
├── gatsby-config.js
├── gatsby-node.js
├── site-metadata.js

│   ├── article-1

└── static
```

## Site Metadata and `useSiteMetadata` Hook

Before jumping right into the actual SEO components we first need to
define the data we are going to pass to it as well as a mechanism for
getting this data. `useSiteMetadata` hook will come to the resque, it
which will be fetching the static data from `gatsby-config.js` and
passing it in react components.

1. gatsby-config + sitematadata
2. useSiteMetadata
