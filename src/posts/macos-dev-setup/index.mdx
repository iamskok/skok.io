# MacOS development setup

I'm starting a new job next week and today I got my MacBook Pro 13 delivered to my home ðŸŽ‰.
Now it's time to get ready for the next week and configure it for web development. The setup
will consist out of several steps. Let's break it down:

1. Install Homebrew package manager.
2. Install CLI apps with `brew`.
3. Install GUI apps with `brew cask`.
4. Install and configure Oh My Zsh.
5. Configure dotfiles.
5. Install and configure VSCode.
6. Install and configure Chrome.

## Install Homebrew package manager

First things first! Let's install MacOS package manager - [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).
Homebrew will install packages to their own directory and then symlinks their files
into `/usr/local`. 

To install Homebrew simply paste this snippet in your termminal:

```sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

The script will install several packages, create new directories, and install Xcode Command Line Tools.
Don't forget to confirm the installation and enter your password. 

```
==> This script will install:`
/usr/local/bin/brew
/usr/local/share/doc/homebrew
/usr/local/share/man/man1/brew.1
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions/_brew
/usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/brew
/usr/local/Homebrew
==> The following new directories will be created:
/usr/local/bin
/usr/local/etc
/usr/local/include
/usr/local/lib
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/share
/usr/local/var
/usr/local/opt
/usr/local/share/zsh
/usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions
/usr/local/var/homebrew
/usr/local/var/homebrew/linked
/usr/local/Cellar
/usr/local/Caskroom
/usr/local/Homebrew
/usr/local/Frameworks
==> The Xcode Command Line Tools will be installed.
```

Just to make sure that the installation went successfully let's run:

```sh
brew --version
```

And you should similar output:

```sh
Homebrew 2.4.7
Homebrew/homebrew-core (git revision e9bb3; last commit 2020-07-18)
Homebrew/homebrew-cask (git revision 7033a; last commit 2020-07-18)
```

Using package manager will automate the whole process of installing, upgrading, configuring, and
removing programs using simple commands. Homebrew's API is pretty concise, here is the list of the
most commonly used commands:

| Command                  | Description                          |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| brew install git         | Install a package.                   |
| brew uninstall git       | Uninstall a package.                 |
| brew upgrade git         | Upgrade a package.                   |
| brew list                | See all installed apps.              |
| brew list --versions git | See what versions you installed.     |
| brew unlink git          | Remove symlink to installation.      |
| brew link git            | Creates symlinks to installations. This allows you to have the flexibility to install things on your own but still have those participate as dependencies in homebrew formulas. |
| brew update              | Fetch latest version of homebrew.    |
| brew doctor              | Check system for potential problems. |

To learn more about Homebrew check out their [documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/) or use
`brew help` / `brew help <sub-command>` to print help information.

## Install CLI apps with Homebrew

Once Homebrew is all set up we can install CLI packages. There are multiple ways to install Node and NPM,
but I prefer to do it via `NVM`, which stands for [Node Version Manager](). It provides a command-line
interface where you can install different versions with a single command, set a default, switch between
them and much more.

```sh
brew install nvm
```

We are also required to create NVM's working directory by running `mkdir ~/.nvm`. If you have been attentive
you probably saw the post installation message about shell configurations, but we are not goint to worry about
it just yet.

Next thing we are going to install is `yarn` package manager. It's a fast, reliable, and secure dependency management.

```sh
brew install yarn
```

Another handly tool is `tree`. It's a recursive directory listing program that produces a depth-indented listing of files.

```sh
brew install tree
```

`ccat` is command line similar to `cat`, but it displays the content of a file with syntax highlighting.

```sh
brew install ccat
```

`gh` is GitHub on the command line. It brings pull requests, issues, and other GitHub concepts to the terminal next to where you are already working with git and your code.

```sh
brew install github/gh/gh
```

One-liner for all of the above:

```sh
brew install tree yarn nvm ccat github/gh/gh && mkdir ~/.nvm
```

## Install GUI apps with Homebrew

Homebrew-Cask is an extension to Homebrew to install GUI applications such as Google Chrome or VSCode.
It started independently but its maintainers now work closely with Homebrewâ€™s core team. It's commands
exactly match the table from the above the only difference is that you have to write `brew cask` instead of 
`brew`, e.g. to install Google Chrome the command will look as: `brew cask install google-chrome`.

Here is the list of apps we are going to install and their corresponding brew package names (feel free
to install any other apps, I'm just show-casing my preferences):

* [Chrome]() `google-chrome`. Don't think that this one needs any intro. We are going to be looking in Chrome extensions further in the article.
* [Firefox]() `firefox`. As well as this one.
* [VScode]() `visiual-studio-code`. The best text editor ever created IMHO.
* [iTerm2]() `iterm2` - more powerful and customizable version of the default terminal app.
* [Authy]()
* [Spectacle]()
* [Telegram]()
* [Notion]()
* [Sourcetree]()
* [Punto Switcher]() - `punto-switcher`
* [Postman]() - 
* [Flux]() - 
* [Raindrop]()
* [1Clipboard]() - 
* [Sizzy]() -
* [Alfred]()
* [Skype]() - 
* [Bartender]() -
* [IINA]() -
* [Lulu]() -
* [Kap]() - 
* [Figma]() - 

And here is the one-liner to install all of these apps:

```sh
`brew cask install visual-studio-code sourcetree authy lastpass google-chrome chromium firefox opera postman spectacle telegram punto-switcher flux iterm2 notion skype raindropio 1clipboard sizzy alfred bartender iina lulu kap figma`
```

After running this script you can take a short break, because it might take a while.

To check out the list of all available apps GUI apps you can visit the [formulae](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/) page.

Once we installed all the apps it's a good time to sort and organize your apps. I
personally prefer to dump all of the default apps in the same folder and move them
away from my eyes on the second page, because I don't use them anyways. And even
you'll need them later you can always use Alfredo for a quick app launch (we are going
to be talking about Alfredo later in the article). [Attach screenshot of your app's screen].
